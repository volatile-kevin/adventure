BUG 1: draw vert line
    addr = img3 + show_y * SCROLL_X_WIDTH + x;

    p_off = (3 - (show_x & 3));

    for(i = 0; i < SCROLL_Y_DIM; i++){
      addr[p_off * SCROLL_SIZE] = buf[i];
      addr += SCROLL_X_WIDTH;
    }

	This code for draw_vert_line is drawing individual lines for every 4th pixel scrolled across the entire screen

	HOW LONG? 1 hr
	WHY? x was not divided by 4 which is necessary as there are 4 total planes
	FIX: starting address (addr) changed to = img3 + show_y * SCROLL_X_WIDTH + (x >> 2)

BUG 2: text to graphics

	either a line, block, or garbage colors were printed to status bar

	HOW LONG? 3 hrs

	WHY? && vs &, indexing was off, show status bar function did not use correct offset or planes


BUG 3: showing status message

	typing "get" right after start prints correct status, but after the first status message, no matter what is typed, "What are you babbling about?" is always shown

	HOW LONG? 30 min

	FIX: must backspace after commands, game design, not actual bug i guess?
